# Proiect_Hamming

A C++ program made with the QtCreator Framework that helps developers track the state of the implementation/development of a program.

In this program you can insert the indicators that have to be done. You have to set some tasks linked to each indicator that will reveal the state of the indicator at any point
in time. The value of indicators will change based of the completion of the their tasks. The Hamming Distance is used to reveal the distance between the current state of the 
project and the ideal value (100%).

You can set the final date of the development the applicaton, and even set any number of stages in this period of time, so the implementation is well-organized.

The program will show the status of the implementation graphically(values for each indicators) at any point in time, and also calculate the recommended value of the average of the
indicators based on the stage number you are in.
